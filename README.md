# HGSVC phase 3 repository

This is the project repository accompanying the phase 3 main ("flagship") publication of the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC).

## Resources

### Data / IGSR FTP

The HGSVC deposits all its data on the public FTP site of [the Internation Genome Sample Resources (IGSR)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/).
Though not accessioned, the IGSR storage location is nevertheless permanent. The `working/` folder captures all data entities, even if they have
never been formally published. The `release/` folder only captures essential production-quality datasets such as variant callsets.

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HGSVC3/release/
```

Please carefully read the **data reuse statement** if you want to use any of the HGSVC resources deposited on the IGSR FTP:

[HGSVC data reuse statement (markdown text)](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HGSVC3/README_HGSVC3_datareuse_statement.md)

For primary data such as sequencing data generated by the HGSVC project partners, please refer to the `Data availability` statement
in the main manuscript and to the respective sections in the Supplemental Material to find the bioproject and data file accessions.

### Software

Any software that had not been published in its own (companion) paper at the time of manuscript writing,
or that does not rise to the level of independence required for publication (e.g., just a bunch of scripts
or workflows chaining together otherwise published tools) is listed in the following table:

[HGSVC3 software resources (TSV table)](software.tsv)

For all other tools used in the HGSVC phase 3 paper, please refer to the `Code availability` statement
in the main manuscript and to the respective Methods sections and references therein.
